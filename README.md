## Udacity Data Science Project 1

Blog post communicating results of work: https://dmlea.github.io/skills-github-pages/2023/07/19/Using-Data-Science-to-Eat-Happily-Across-Europe.html

## Motivation for project and choice of dataset

Project was undertaken to gain experience in writing Python code to apply data science principles to the analysis of a publicly available dataset,
then writing a blog to communicate the results to a non-technical audience.  Dataset was chosen based on my interest in the subject matter and the
relatively simple nature of the data.

## Summary of results

Jupyter notebook analyzes a dataset of European restaurant ratings, providing answers to three questions:

    1) Which cities have the highest rated low and moderately priced restaurants?

    2) Regardless of price range, which cities have the highest average ratings for Mediterranean and Vegetarian Friendly restaurants?

    3) Which cities would be good candidates for opening an American restaurant?
